ttree
=====

It's a project I started a couple of years ago, a T*-tree binary tree implementation written in C (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-tree).
I have never had enough time to nail it down. May be placing it here will motivate me (or somebody else) to give this project some love
it definitely needs.

How to build
------------

    % cd libttree
    % cmake CMakeLists.txt
    ...
    % make
    % ls libttree.a // that's the library file
